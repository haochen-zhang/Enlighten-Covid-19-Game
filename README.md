## Background

Considering that the worldwide and long-lasting Covid-19 pandemic has been imposing significant restrictions on everyone's life, this project tries to develop an AR-based version of Matta Clark's portal, to break the limited physical space and to expand the diversity of perception in a single place.

By grasping, clicking, or pointing, users can switch, put, or delete the real world's portals through the screen. We have set 3 different space themes, including a natural terrain, a shopping mall, and a playground, which users can see or experience through the corresponding portal. Have Fun!
